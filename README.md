# Valorant Checker

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript solo AJAX project using the [unofficial Valorant API](https://valorant-api.com/) to display various details about playable characters and weapons.

* It has a user-friendly interface with a custom filter table that allows users to easily sort and filter the information they want to see.
* The layout of the website is organized using HTML 5, allowing for seamless view swapping and a more cohesive user experience.
* The website is also optimized for multiple viewports, ensuring that it works properly across different devices.
* The use of CSS 3 enables the alternating style of each row, making it easier for users to differentiate between adjacent rows.
* By using JavaScript ES5, the website can create new XMLHTTPRequests and fill the page with the corresponding data based on the user's selected filters.
